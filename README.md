## Getting VIA to support your keyboard

Are you a keyboard maker or a developer interested in adding support for your keyboard? We welcome contributions to the VIA project!

1. The source code of the keyboard **has to be merged** in [QMK Firmware Repositories](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) Master branch.
2. Your `keymaps/via` keymap **has to be merged** in [VIA's QMK Userspace Repository](https://github.com/the-via/qmk_userspace_via) Main branch.
3. Create a definition in JSON format for your keyboard and submit it as a pull request to [VIA's Keyboards Repository](https://github.com/the-via/keyboards) Master branch.

Please follow our [Specification documentation](https://www.caniusevia.com/docs/specification) carefully to ensure your pull request is smoothly reviewed and merged.
